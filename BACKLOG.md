# Backlog

This is a list of features I might implement in future versions

- Built-in Password Generator
- Admin Interface
- Prometheus Metrics
- Optionally keep metadata when secret expires in order to tell the recipient why a link no longer works (does not exists/already expired/burned)
- Quantum Encryption
